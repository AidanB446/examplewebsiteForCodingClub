<!DOCTYPE html>

<! You can honestly learn html in a day, so i wouldnt look at this document
if your goal is to learn the language syntax from it :/

but if you just want to see basic frontend dev then this is the bare basic stuff yk>

<! And if there is a certain element you dont understand, i highly recomend MDN web docs>



<html>
	<title>Example website</title>
	<body>
		<form method="get"> 
			
			<! My personal opinion, if you're getting user input, even without backend intergration, you should wrap it
			in a form tag just to make it more comprehendable when reading>

			<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Message" id="textbox1"/><br><br>
			<! Placeholder is just the shadowed text in the textbox before we write in it>

			<button id="button1" type="button"  onclick="getData()">Submit</button><br><br>
			<! the onclick attribute states that the function 'getData()' will run when the button is clicked; thats how we make
			stuff happen when the button is pressed>

		</form>

		<div id="userOutput">
			hello there
		</div>

		<div id="directions">
	
			<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">write some text into the Enter Message box, then
				click submit
			</p>
			<! we can write css directly in the element by using the style attribute>

			<p style="color: aqua; font-family: sans-serif;">
				If you're looking for help understanding the basic syntax of html, js, or css. W3Schools has really good basic
				examples that id personally recommend.<br><br>
				https://www.w3schools.com/

	</body>
